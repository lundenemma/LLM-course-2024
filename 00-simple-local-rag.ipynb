        "\n",
        "Two primary improvements can be seen as:\n",
        "1. **Preventing hallucinations** - LLMs are incredible but they are prone to potential hallucination, as in, generating something that *looks* correct but isn't. RAG pipelines can help LLMs generate more factual outputs by providing them with factual (retrieved) inputs. And even if the generated answer from a RAG pipeline doesn't seem correct, because of retrieval, you also have access to the sources where it came from.\n",
        "2. **Work with custom data** - Many base LLMs are trained with internet-scale text data. This means they have a great ability to model language, however, they often lack specific knowledge. RAG systems can provide LLMs with domain-specific data such as medical information or company documentation and thus customized their outputs to suit specific use cases.\n",

        "For example you could use RAG for:\n",
        "* **Customer support Q&A chat** - By treating your existing customer support documentation as a resource, when a customer asks a question, you could have a system retrieve relevant documentation snippets and then have an LLM craft those snippets into an answer. Think of this as a \"chatbot for your documentation\". Klarna, a large financial company, [uses a system like this](https://www.klarna.com/international/press/klarna-ai-assistant-handles-two-thirds-of-customer-service-chats-in-its-first-month/) to save $40M per year on customer support costs.\n",
        "* **Email chain analysis** - Let's say you're an insurance company with long threads of emails between customers and insurance agents. Instead of searching through each individual email, you could retrieve relevant passages and have an LLM create strucutred outputs of insurance claims.\n",
        "* **Company internal documentation chat** - If you've worked at a large company, you know how hard it can be to get an answer sometimes. Why not let a RAG system index your company information and have an LLM answer questions you may have? The benefit of RAG is that you will have references to resources to learn more if the LLM answer doesn't suffice.\n",
        "* **Textbook Q&A** - Let's say you're studying for your exams and constantly flicking through a large textbook looking for answers to your quesitons. RAG can help provide answers as well as references to learn more.\n",

        "| ----- | ----- |\n",
        "| **Token** | A sub-word piece of text. For example, \"hello, world!\" could be split into [\"hello\", \",\", \"world\", \"!\"]. A token can be a whole word,<br> part of a word or group of punctuation characters. 1 token ~= 4 characters in English, 100 tokens ~= 75 words.<br> Text gets broken into tokens before being passed to an LLM. |\n",
        "| **Embedding** | A learned numerical representation of a piece of data. For example, a sentence of text could be represented by a vector with<br> 768 values. Similar pieces of text (in meaning) will ideally have similar values. |\n",
        "| **Embedding model** | A model designed to accept input data and output a numerical representation. For example, a text embedding model may take in 384 <br>tokens of text and turn it into a vector of size 768. An embedding model can and often is different to an LLM model. |\n",
        "| **Similarity search/vector search** | Similarity search/vector search aims to find two vectors which are close together in high-demensional space. For example, <br>two pieces of similar text passed through an embedding model should have a high similarity score, whereas two pieces of text about<br> different topics will have a lower similarity score. Common similarity score measures are dot product and cosine similarity. |\n",
        "| **Large Language Model (LLM)** | A model which has been trained to numerically represent the patterns in text. A generative LLM will continue a sequence when given a sequence. <br>For example, given a sequence of the text \"hello, world!\", a genertive LLM may produce \"we're going to build a RAG pipeline today!\".<br> This generation will be highly dependant on the training data and prompt. |\n",
        "| **LLM context window** | The number of tokens a LLM can accept as input. For example, as of March 2024, GPT-4 has a default context window of 32k tokens<br> (about 96 pages of text) but can go up to 128k if needed. A recent open-source LLM from Google, Gemma (March 2024) has a context<br> window of 8,192 tokens (about 24 pages of text). A higher context window means an LLM can accept more relevant information<br> to assist with a query. For example, in a RAG pipeline, if a model has a larger context window, it can accept more reference items<br> from the retrieval system to aid with its generation. |\n",
        "| **Prompt** | A common term for describing the input to a generative LLM. The idea of \"[prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering)\" is to structure a text-based<br> (or potentially image-based as well) input to a generative LLM in a specific way so that the generated output is ideal. This technique is<br> possible because of a LLMs capacity for in-context learning, as in, it is able to use its representation of language to breakdown <br>the prompt and recognize what a suitable output may be (note: the output of LLMs is probable, so terms like \"may output\" are used). |\n",

La conjugación regular  2.1 Introducción Se entiende por conjugación el conjunto de formas  ﬂexionadas que pertenecen a un verbo para expresar las  distintas categorías gramaticales de persona, número, tiempo,  aspecto, modo y voz. La conjugación del verbo es regular cuando las distintas  formas que adopta éste se ajustan a un determinado paradigma  o modelo general, que es presentado en esta sección. Por contra,  la conjugación de un verbo es irregular, cuando se aparta de los  modelos paradigmáticos genéricos, bien sea porque experimenta  variaciones en la raíz o bien sea porque incluya desinencias  desacordes con el modelo. Los verbos se clasiﬁcan en tres grupos en función de las  distintas terminaciones del inﬁnitivo (-ar, -er, -ir). La primera  conjugación comprende los verbos cuyo inﬁnitivo termina en -ar  (amar), la segunda conjugación los que terminan en -er (comer)  y la tercera conjugación los terminados en -ir (vivir). Sin embargo, si se analizan las formas ﬂexivas de cada  conjugación, se observará que las tres conjugaciones son bien  parecidas, sobre todo la segunda y la tercera que sólo varían en  la forma del inﬁnitivo y en la primera y en la segunda persona  de plural del presente de indicativo.  2.2 Formación de un verbo regular El proceso que sigue un verbo regular para la conjugación  de las formas ﬂexivas consiste en:   Los verbos en español. Construye el verbo que quieras desde el primer día — www.molinodelideas.es 1º Extraer la raíz del verbo      +     2º Seleccionar las desinencias 1 — Obtenemos la raíz del verbo mediante la eliminación de la  terminación del infinitivo (-ar, -er o -ir) excepto para los  tiempos de futuro simple y condicional simple de indicativo. 2 — Una vez que hemos extraído la raíz del verbo y hemos identificado la conjugación a la que  pertenece (-ar, -er, -ir), seleccionaremos las desinencias correspondientes a cada forma verbal y  las añadiremos a la raíz. Truco  ;-) Las formas verbales del imperativo coinciden con las  formas de presente de subjuntivo excepto en las  segundas personas de singular y de plural.

Diptongación y alternancias  vocálicas en la raíz Los verbos que pertenecen a este grupo se ven afectados por   cambios de diptongación y alternancias vocálicas en la raíz. La diptongación consiste en la alternancia en la raíz del verbo  entre una vocal y un diptongo en determinadas personas y tiempos  (cuento de contar). Esta alternancia está motivada por la  acentuación de la vocal de la raíz: si esa sílaba es tónica habrá un  diptongo y si es átona se mantendrá la vocal del inﬁnitivo (contaba  de contar). Existe una relación establecida entre una vocal y el diptongo  con el que puede alternar: — las vocales e o i sólo pueden alternar con el diptongo ie; — las vocales o o u sólo pueden alternar con el diptongo ue. Las alternancias vocálicas en la raíz consisten en el cambio de  una vocal a otra (sirvo de servir). No obstante, al igual que pasa  con los diptongos, dicho cambio no es aleatorio, sino que se produce  entre determinadas vocales: —la vocal e sólo alterna con la vocal i y viceversa; —la vocal o sólo alterna con la vocal u y viceversa.

Ir es muy irregular, proviniendo la mayoría de sus  particularidades de la propia conjugación latina. Así, por ejemplo,  algunos tiempos como el pretérito perfecto simple (fui, fuiste,  fuimos, etc.) no guardan ningún parecido formal con el inﬁnitivo. En el caso de dar y ver, aunque no podamos decir que la d y  la v son sus respectivas raíces, desde el punto de vista de la  conjugación de ambos verbos sí podemos admitir que son  precisamente sus iniciales las que pertenecen invariables a lo largo  de sus paradigmas. Es por esto por lo que en bastantes ocasiones  nos encontraremos que la forma verbal está constituida únicamente  por la inicial y por la desinencia. Pese a todo, dar y ser se comportan como verbos de la  primera y de la segunda conjugación respectivamente, por lo que  utilizan las desinencias propias de éstas, salgo en contadas  excepciones como doy.

The microbes can reactivate when the food is taken out and thawed. Many different kinds of bacteria can lead to food infections. One of the most common is Salmonella, which is found in the intestines of birds, reptiles, and mammals. Salmonella can spread to humans via a variety of different animal-origin foods, including meats, poultry, eggs, dairy products, and seafood. The disease it causes, salmonellosis, typically brings about fever, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps within twelve to seventy-two hours after eating. Usually, the illness lasts four to seven days, and most people recover without treatment. However, in individuals with weakened immune systems, Salmonella can invade the bloodstream and lead to life-threatening complications, such as a high fever and severe diarrhea.1 1.\\xa0Salmonella.

        "An [embedding](https://vickiboykis.com/what_are_embeddings/index.html) is a broad concept.\n",
        "\n",
        "But one of my favourite and simple definitions is \"a useful numerical representation\".\n",
        "\n",
        "The most powerful thing about modern embeddings is that they are *learned* representations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Meaning rather than directly mapping words/tokens/characters to numbers directly (e.g. `{\"a\": 0, \"b\": 1, \"c\": 3...}`), the numerical representation of tokens is learned by going through large corpuses of text and figuring out how different tokens relate to each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ideally, embeddings of text will mean that similar meaning texts have similar numerical representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Note:** Most modern NLP models deal with \"tokens\" which can be considered as multiple different sizes and combinations of words and characters rather than always whole words or single characters. For example, the string `\"hello world!\"` gets mapped to the token values `{15339: b'hello', 1917: b' world', 0: b'!'}` using [Byte pair encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding) (or BPE via OpenAI's [`tiktoken`](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) library). Google has a tokenization library called [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece).\n",
        "\n",
        "Our goal is to turn each of our chunks into a numerical representation (an embedding vector, where a vector is a sequence of numbers arranged in order).\n",
        "\n",
        "Once our text samples are in embedding vectors, us humans will no longer be able to understand them.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, we don't need to.\n",
        "\n",
        "The embedding vectors are for our computers to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll use our computers to find patterns in the embeddings and then we can use their text mappings to further our understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "Enough talking, how about we import a text embedding model and see what an embedding looks like.\n",
        "\n",
        "To do so, we'll use the [`sentence-transformers`](https://www.sbert.net/docs/installation.html) library which contains many pre-trained embedding models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, we'll get the `all-mpnet-base-v2` model (you can see the model's intended use on the [Hugging Face model card](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2#intended-uses))."

Therefore, reversing or improving these factors by lifestyle interventions markedly improve the overall health of Type 2 diabetics and lower blood-glucose levels. In fact it has been shown that when people are overweight, losing as little as nine pounds (four kilograms) decreases blood- glucose levels in Type 2 diabetics. The Diabetes Prevention Trial demonstrated that by adhering to a diet containing between 1,200 and 1,800 kilocalories per day with a dietary fat intake goal of less than 25 percent and increasing physical activity to at least 150 minutes per week, people at high risk for Type 2 diabetes achieved a weight loss of 7 percent and significantly decreased their chances of developing Type 2 diabetes.15 The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has a website that provides information and tips for helping diabetics answer the question, \\u201cWhat Can I Eat\\u201d. In regard to carbohydrates the ADA recommends diabetics keep track of the carbohydrates they eat and set a limit. These dietary practices will help keep blood-glucose levels in the target range.

It attracts and holds onto fat while it is simultaneously attracted to and held on to by water. Emulsification increases the surface area of lipids over a thousand- fold, making them more accessible to the digestive enzymes. Once the stomach contents have been emulsified, fat-breaking enzymes work on the triglycerides and diglycerides to sever fatty acids from their glycerol foundations. As pancreatic lipase enters the small intestine, it breaks down the fats into free fatty acids and monoglycerides. Yet again, another hurdle presents itself. How will the fats pass through the watery layer of mucus that coats the absorptive lining of the digestive tract?As before, the answer is bile. Bile salts envelop the fatty acids and monoglycerides to form micelles. Micelles have a fatty acid core with a water-soluble exterior.\",\n          \"Image by\\u00a0Gtirouflet / CC BY-SA 3.0 dense cortical bone is about 10 percent porous and it looks like many concentric circles, similar to the rings in a tree trunk, sandwiched together (Figure 2.27 \\u201cCortical (Compact) Bone\\u201d).

        "\n",
        "> **Which embedding model should I use?**\n",
        "\n",
        "This depends on many factors. My best advice is to experiment, experiment, experiment!\n",
        "\n",
        "If you want the model to run locally, you'll have to make sure it's feasible to run on your own hardware.\n",
        "\n",
        "A good place to see how different models perform on a wide range of embedding tasks is the [Hugging Face Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard).\n",
        "\n",
        "> **What other forms of text chunking/splitting are there?**\n",
        "\n",
        "There are a fair few options here too. We've kept it simple with groups of sentences.\n",
        "\n",
        "For more, [Pinecone has a great guide on different kinds of chunking](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/chunking-strategies/) including for different kinds of data such as markdown and LaTeX.\n",
        "\n",

        "> **What should I think about when creating my embeddings?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Our model turns text inputs up to 384 tokens long in embedding vectors of size 768.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generally, the larger the vector size, the more information that gets encoded into the embedding (however, this is not always the case, as smaller, better models can outperform larger ones).\n",
        "\n",
        "Though with larger vector sizes comes larger storage and compute requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our model is also relatively small (420MB) in size compared to larger models that are available.\n",
        "\n",
        "Larger models may result in better performance but will also require more compute.\n",
        "\n",
        "So some things to think about:\n",
        "* Size of input - If you need to embed longer sequences, choose a model with a larger input capacity.\n",
        "* Size of embedding vector - Larger is generally a better representation but requires more compute/storage.\n",
        "* Size of model - Larger models generally result in better embeddings but require more compute power/time to run.\n",
        "* Open or closed - Open models allow you to run them on your own hardware whereas closed models can be easier to setup but require an API call to get embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Where should I store my embeddings?**\n",
        "\n",
        "If you've got a relatively small dataset, for example, under 100,000 examples (this number is rough and only based on first hand experience), `np.array` or `torch.tensor` can work just fine as your dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "But if you've got a production system and want to work with 100,000+ embeddings, you may want to look into a [vector database]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_database) (these have become very popular lately and there are many offerings).\n",

        "\n",
        "We discussed RAG briefly in the beginning but let's quickly recap.\n",
        "\n",
        "RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Which is another way of saying \"given a query, search for relevant resources and answer based on those resources\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's breakdown each step:\n",
        "* **Retrieval** - Get relevant resources given a query. For example, if the query is \"what are the macronutrients?\" the ideal results will contain information about protein, carbohydrates and fats (and possibly alcohol) rather than information about which tractors are the best for farming (though that is also cool information).\n",
        "* **Augmentation** - LLMs are capable of generating text given a prompt. However, this generated text is designed to *look* right. And it often has some correct information, however, they are prone to hallucination (generating a result that *looks* like legit text but is factually wrong). In augmentation, we pass relevant information into the prompt and get an LLM to use that relevant information as the basis of its generation.\n",
        "* **Generation** - This is where the LLM will generate a response that has been flavoured/augmented with the retrieved resources. In turn, this not only gives us a potentially more correct answer, it also gives us resources to investigate more (since we know which resources went into the prompt).\n",
        "\n",
        "The whole idea of RAG is to get an LLM to be more factually correct based on your own input as well as have a reference to where the generated output may have come from.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is an incredibly helpful tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's say you had 1000s of customer support documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "You could use RAG to generate direct answers to questions with links to relevant documentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Or you were an insurance company with large chains of claims emails.\n",
        "\n",
        "You could use RAG to answer questions about the emails with sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "One helpful analogy is to think of LLMs as calculators for words.\n",
        "\n",
        "With good inputs, the LLM can sort them into helpful outputs.\n",

Therefore, reversing or improving these factors by lifestyle interventions markedly improve the overall health of Type 2 diabetics and lower blood-glucose levels. In fact it has been shown that when people are overweight, losing as little as nine pounds (four kilograms) decreases blood- glucose levels in Type 2 diabetics. The Diabetes Prevention Trial demonstrated that by adhering to a diet containing between 1,200 and 1,800 kilocalories per day with a dietary fat intake goal of less than 25 percent and increasing physical activity to at least 150 minutes per week, people at high risk for Type 2 diabetes achieved a weight loss of 7 percent and significantly decreased their chances of developing Type 2 diabetes.15 The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has a website that provides information and tips for helping diabetics answer the question, \\u201cWhat Can I Eat\\u201d. In regard to carbohydrates the ADA recommends diabetics keep track of the carbohydrates they eat and set a limit. These dietary practices will help keep blood-glucose levels in the target range.

It attracts and holds onto fat while it is simultaneously attracted to and held on to by water. Emulsification increases the surface area of lipids over a thousand- fold, making them more accessible to the digestive enzymes. Once the stomach contents have been emulsified, fat-breaking enzymes work on the triglycerides and diglycerides to sever fatty acids from their glycerol foundations. As pancreatic lipase enters the small intestine, it breaks down the fats into free fatty acids and monoglycerides. Yet again, another hurdle presents itself. How will the fats pass through the watery layer of mucus that coats the absorptive lining of the digestive tract?As before, the answer is bile. Bile salts envelop the fatty acids and monoglycerides to form micelles. Micelles have a fatty acid core with a water-soluble exterior.\",\n          \"Image by\\u00a0Gtirouflet / CC BY-SA 3.0 dense cortical bone is about 10 percent porous and it looks like many concentric circles, similar to the rings in a tree trunk, sandwiched together (Figure 2.27 \\u201cCortical (Compact) Bone\\u201d).

        "Answer: The fat-soluble vitamins include Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, and Vitamin K. These vitamins are absorbed along with fats in the diet and can be stored in the body's fatty tissue and liver for later use. Vitamin A is important for vision, immune function, and skin health. Vitamin D plays a critical role in calcium absorption and bone health. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone metabolism.\n",
        "\\nExample 2:\n",
        "Query: What are the causes of type 2 diabetes?\n",
        "Answer: Type 2 diabetes is often associated with overnutrition, particularly the overconsumption of calories leading to obesity. Factors include a diet high in refined sugars and saturated fats, which can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Over time, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, resulting in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, excessive caloric intake without sufficient physical activity exacerbates the risk by promoting weight gain and fat accumulation, particularly around the abdomen, further contributing to insulin resistance.\n",
        "\\nExample 3:\n",
        "Query: What is the importance of hydration for physical performance?\n",
        "Answer: Hydration is crucial for physical performance because water plays key roles in maintaining blood volume, regulating body temperature, and ensuring the transport of nutrients and oxygen to cells. Adequate hydration is essential for optimal muscle function, endurance, and recovery. Dehydration can lead to decreased performance, fatigue, and increased risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke. Drinking sufficient water before, during, and after exercise helps ensure peak physical performance and recovery.\n",
